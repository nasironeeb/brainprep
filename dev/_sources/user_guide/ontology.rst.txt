Data Organization Ontology
==========================

The following ontology is used to structure and organize data on disk for
neuroimaging analyses. The system supports three hierarchical levels of
analysis: **subject-level**, **group-level**, and **longitudinal**.
Each level corresponds to a specific directory structure and naming convention
to ensure consistency, traceability, and compatibility with processing
pipelines.

Analysis Levels
---------------

1. **Subject-Level Analysis**

- Data is organized per individual subject.
- Root directory: `subjects/`.
- Each subject has a dedicated subdirectory named using a unique
  identifier (e.g., `sub-001`, `sub-002`).
- Within each subject directory, session-specific data is stored in
  subdirectories following the BIDS convention (e.g., `ses-01`, `ses-02`).
- Example path: `subjects/sub-001/ses-01/`.

2. **Group-Level Analysis**

- Data is aggregated across subjects for group-level processing.
- Root directory: `quality_check/`, `morphometry/`, `statistic/`.
- Each group-level analysis type has its own named directory:

  - `quality_check/` for quality control metrics.
  - `morphometry/` for structural measurements.
  - `statistic/` for statistical outputs.

- These directories contain results derived from multiple subjects and
  sessions, often in tabular or summary formats.

3. **Longitudinal Analysis**

- Data is structured to support longitudinal studies across multiple
  timepoints.
- Root directory: `longitudinal/`.
- Contains subject-wise data aggregated across sessions and timepoints.
- May include harmonized metrics, trajectory models, or longitudinal
  statistical outputs.
- Example path: `longitudinal/subject/sub-001/ses-01/`.

Metadata and Logs
-----------------

A `dataset_description.json` file is placed at the root of the dataset. This
file documents:
- The tool or pipeline used for processing.
- The version of the tool.
- The container technology used (Docker image), if applicable.

A `log/` directory is maintained at the root level to store logs from all
processing steps. One key log file is `report_<timestamp>.rst`, which provides
a comprehensive report of:
- All processing steps executed.
- Input and output file locations for each step.
- Runtime information for each step.

Directory Overview
------------------

The overall structure can be visualized as:

::

    data_root/
    ├── subjects/
    │   ├── sub-001/
    │   │   ├── ses-01/
    │   │   └── ses-02/
    │   └── sub-002/
    │       └── ses-01/
    ├── quality_check/
    ├── morphometry/
    ├── statistic/
    ├── longitudinal/
    │   ├── subjects
    │   │   ├── sub-001/
    │   │   └── sub-002/
    │   └── quality_check
    ├── log/
    │   └── report.rst
    └── dataset_description.json

In a tool that relies on a non-typed ontology, multiple runs of the same
modality may occur within a single session, which can lead to naming
conflicts. In such cases, an additional ``run-<ID>`` subdirectory is created.
When the run identifier is missing from the filename, or when several images
of the same modality share the same run identifier, a deterministic five-digit
identifier is generated from the filename using a UUID.
This ensures stable and reproducible naming.
To guarantee uniqueness of run identifiers within the session folder, we
check for duplicates and issues a warning if a conflict is detected.
